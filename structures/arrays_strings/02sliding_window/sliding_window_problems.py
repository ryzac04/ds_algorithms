# Buy and Sell Crypto
# You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of NeetCoin on the ith day.

# You may choose a single day to buy one NeetCoin and choose a different day in the future to sell it.

# Return the maximum profit you can achieve. You may choose to not make any transactions, in which case the profit would be 0.

#     Time Complexity: O(n) for length of prices array
#     Space Complexity: O(1) d/t use of two pointers - no data structure

# A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

# Longest Repeating Substring With Replacement
# You are given a string s consisting of only uppercase english characters and an integer k. You can choose up to k characters of the string and replace them with any other uppercase English character.

# After performing at most k replacements, return the length of the longest substring which contains only one distinct character.

#     Time Complexity: O(n)
#     Space Complexity: O(m)
#     Where n is the length of the string and m is the total number of unique characters in the string.
