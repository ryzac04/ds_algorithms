# Buy and Sell Crypto
# You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of NeetCoin on the ith day.

# You may choose a single day to buy one NeetCoin and choose a different day in the future to sell it.

# Return the maximum profit you can achieve. You may choose to not make any transactions, in which case the profit would be 0.

#     Time Complexity: O(n) for length of prices array
#     Space Complexity: O(1) d/t use of two pointers - no data structure
